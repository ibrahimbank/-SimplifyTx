## 🧪 Validation & Edge Cases
✅ Amount must be a positive number.

✅ Date must not be in the future.

✅ Filters work with debounce to reduce re-renders.

✅ API errors are gracefully handled.

## 🧠 My Approach
- Core UI & State: Built with React and Next.js using useState, useEffect for local state and Axios for API interaction.

- Filters: Used a separate FilterSection component with controlled inputs and debounce logic.

- Form Validation: Manually validated form inputs before posting data.

- Routing: Used Next.js pages for index.js (transaction list) and new-transaction.js (create form).
  
- For generating data, i used https://mockapi.io/, to create a mock data that i can use, base on the required data format

## Tech Stack
1. Frontend:
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Material-UI 5
- Axios

2. Build Tools:

- Webpack
- Babel
